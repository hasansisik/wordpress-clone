# WordPress Clone Editor Improvements

## Editor System Overview

The WordPress clone editor system has been completely restructured to provide a more efficient and user-friendly editing experience. The key improvements include:

### 1. Simplified Editor Structure

- Removed the editor mode functionality, keeping only the sidebar editing and live preview
- Eliminated visual in-preview editing capabilities while maintaining the preview functionality
- Reduced complexity by removing mode toggling and related state management

### 2. Modular Component Architecture

- Created reusable form field components in `FormFields.tsx`
- Developed a flexible `EditorProvider` for centralized state management
- Built modular sidebar components that work with different content types
- Implemented a generic content preview system

### 3. Improved User Experience

- Organized editing controls into logical tabs (Layout, Content, Style, Media)
- Simplified the UI by removing unnecessary toggles and controls
- Made responsive preview options (desktop/tablet/mobile) more intuitive
- Created a more efficient image upload workflow

### 4. Better Extensibility

- Implemented a clean abstraction between data models and UI components
- Made it easy to add new section types without restructuring the system
- Created consistent naming patterns across components
- Developed standardized API communication for all content types

## Key Components

1. **EditorProvider**: Central state management for editing sessions
2. **EditorLayout**: Main layout component for all editor pages
3. **EditorSidebar**: Flexible sidebar that can render different form fields
4. **FormFields**: Collection of reusable form field components
5. **SectionPreview**: Renders live previews with responsive options

This new architecture ensures a better development experience while making the system easier to maintain and extend with new features.
